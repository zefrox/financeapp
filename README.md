## üìñ Description

This Backend project is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and is a modular and scalable architecture that provides a secure and scalable way of creating applications. It is configured to work with MongoDB as a database and Docker as an efficient development environment.

## üîß Technologies

- **Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- **Containers**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- **Testing**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- **ORM**: [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Code Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## üíª Installation

To install the project, go to the project directory and execute:
```bash
npm install
```
Then, to run the application, execute:
```bash

```
This project uses the layer pattern to organize the application's layers:

- **Domain**: this layer contains entities and services that manage the business logic.
- **Infrastructure**: this layer contains services that interact with the database and containers.
- **Application**: this layer contains services that integrate the business logic and infrastructure.

üê≥ Docker
This project is ready to run in a Dockerized environment. Use the following command to launch the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## üìä Roadmap
